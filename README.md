# My-Weather-Dashboard

## Description 

This respository ("My-Weather-Dashboard") is the latest challenge set as part of the Frontend Development Bootcamp, with the aim of using third-party APIs to extract their information to our own projects. In this case, it is using a third-party API to collect data not only on today's weather forecast, but collecting data on the 5 Day Forecast also. This utilises Day.js as well as more JQuery to create a dashboard that should result in both results when the user inputs a city into the form and clicks 'search'. Using local.storage, the user will be able to keep their recently searched cities on their local computer, so that there is no need for duplication of searching.

## Usage 

This respository should demonstrate the use of a weather dashboard, utilising Javascript's ability to fetch information from third-party API's and presenting the necessary data in a concise, accessible format for the user. Once opening the page, the user will be presented with the opportunity to input a city of their choosing, which will then be saved to local.storage. The forecast for that day will be presented at the top of the page, with the 5 day forecast below it, with an icon representing the conditions on that day. It will show the date, temperature, humidity and wind speed, all in metric measurements. 

Local.storage will enable the user to save their most recently searched cities on the left-hand side of the page, where if it is pressed again, the information will be presented again. There is also an option for 'clear history' which clears local.storage so that the user can start afresh.
